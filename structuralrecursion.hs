-- A structurally recursive function f :: [a] -> b is isomorphic to a list
-- fold, which can be incrementalized as (a -> b -> b, b).  Any function which
-- consumes [a] in a structurally recursive way (but does not necessarily use its
-- own result recursively) can be incrementalized on the structural part; that is:
-- âˆƒ s. (a -> s -> s, s, s -> b)

-- LF a b = list function = [a] -> b
data LF a b = forall s. LF (a -> s -> s) s (s -> b)

-- We generalize this to any recursive structure

newtype Mu f = Roll { unroll :: f (Mu f) }

-- MF b = mu function = Mu f -> b
data MF f b = forall s. MF (f s -> s) (s -> b)


-- (x:xs, y:ys) has an unusual structure
--
--         (x:xs, y:ys)
--        /            \
--   (xs, y:ys)     (x:xs, ys)
--        \           /
--           (xs, ys)

-- merge :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a] is structurally recursive in this way. 
-- It should be easy to incrementally compute an update (prepend) to either list.

-- L2F a b c = [a] * [b] -> [c]
data L2F a b c = 
    forall s. L2F (LF b s)   -- left empty 
                  (LF a s)   -- right empty
                  (a -> b -> s -> s -> s) -- left sub, right sub
                  (s -> c)

The point is to tag every point in the structural tree with an s.  Products
have interesting tree (well, dag) structures.

-- So L2F can be folded naively (like a tree) or smartly (like this dag).  It's
-- up to the consumer, offering the possibility for more composable efficiency than
-- before.
